dotnet build
```
***Run Command***
``` bash
dotnet run --launch-profile https
```

***Start the server with .NET Hot Reload (to be able to make changes to the server without restarting):***

```
## Testing
Test the API Endpoints by:
- First Authenticating with the https://localhost/7290/login
- This will redirect you to https://localhost/7290/swagger
- All Endpoints will be listed on Swagger. 
## MVP Tiers


### Tier 4 - Authorization
- As a User, I want my API protected from unauthorized Users
- As an unauthorized User, I want a helpful message telling me I do not have access to the API
(optional, but recommended): As a user, I want to receive a helpful error message anytime there is a problem with the request (i.e. error handling middleware)
- As a User, I expect not to be able to create new entities without first logging in / authenticating in some way (token/session)
- As a User, I want my data to only be accessible by myself
- As a User, I want my data to only be editable/deletable by myself

### Tier 5 - Associated Data
***In addition to the Tier 1 MVP criteria…***
- As a User, I want to be able to read a single entry
- As a User requesting a single entry, I want to see the associated user info and other associated data. For example, if your API is a concert, instead of just the concert, I want to see who created the concert entry, as well as the associated location data, artist info, and attendees coming to the event.

### Tier 6 - Admin vs User
- As an Admin, I want to have a special super-user account type that allows access to content Users don’t have access to
- As a basic User, when requesting a list of all entries, I expect to only see my own entries (not entries of other users)
- As an Admin, when requesting a list of all entries, I expect to be able to see all entries, regardless of user/owner
- As an Admin, I want to be able to edit other users’ information via the API
- As an Admin, I want to be able to delete or edit any entity, regardless of user/owner

## Bonus Goals
### Bonus Goal 1: Front End Login
- As a User, I want to be able to use a client-side form to Log in/out of my application.
- As a User, I want to be able to sign up using a client-side form.
This could be via a traditional web form, or more preferably, with a React app.

### Bonus Goal 2: Seed
- As a Developer cloning the repo for the first time, I want to be able to run a seed command and have the database populated with data.
-As a Developer, I want multiple users to be seeded to the database

### Bonus Goal 3: Testing
- As a Developer, I want to be able to run a test command (such as npm test or the command specific to your technology/project) and have all my tests run.
- As a Developer, I want to know if my new code has broken anything (passing tests means it theoretically didn’t)

### Bonus Goal 4: Continuous Integration
- As a Developer, I want the tests to run each time I open a PR to the main branch.
- As a Developer, I want failing tests to block a merge to main
***Note: GitHub Actions or TravisCI are each great options for this.***

### Bonus Goal 5: Pagination
- As a Developer, I want to see many (Hundreds? Thousands?) entries seeded to use in testing. (Use an external package like faker to generate the data)
- As a User requesting all entries, I want to receive paginated data (10 results instead of 5K)
- As a User requesting all entries, I want to be able to request the next “page” or set of data
- As a User requesting all entries, I want to be able to edit the page size (10 results at a time vs 50 or other amount)

### Bonus Goal 6: External API Automation
***You could integrate external API for cool and fun functionality. Feel free to let your imagination soar! But here are a couple examples:***
- Intermediate - As a User signing up, I want to receive an email confirmation upon registration. Use something like SendGrid - (100 free emails per day)
- Advanced - As an Admin, I want to receive a daily email report with data about my entities (inventory value, daily throughput, etc). I expect the report to come in at the same time every day. You could achieve this by creating an interval-based Cron Job, running on a serverless host like Google Cloud or AWS Lambda.

### Bonus Goal 7: Front End Application
**Heads-up, this is a big one!**
***Beyond just login:***
- As a User, I want to access, create, edit, and delete my data all from a front-end GUI application.
- As a returning user, I want to be automatically logged in, instead of having to enter my credentials each time I revisit the application.
- As a User, I want my app to be visually stunning
